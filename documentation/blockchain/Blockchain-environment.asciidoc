If you click the begin button you can export your wallets with your seed phrase and your password, or you can create a new one

Once you have your wallet imported or created in the extension you may consult the private key, seed phrase, you may generate more addresses, etc...

=== Infura

Infura provides the tools and infrastructure that allow developers to easily take their blockchain application from testing to scaled deployment - with simple, reliable access to Ethereum and IPFS.

The interaction with the Ethereum network must be done through a client node that allows sending requests, We will utilize Infura for this.

All you have to do is go to the https://infura.io/[Infura website] and create an account to begin creating new projects. 


=== Etherscan

https://etherscan.io/[Etherscan] is a block explorer and analytics platform that provides information on each Ethereum blockchain transaction, whether it is pending or confirmed.

Etherscan, sometimes known as "Ethplorer," is the most reliable tool for traversing through all of the public data on the Ethereum blockchain. This data includes transaction data, wallet addresses and smart contracts.

On the next image you can see all of the important sections of the ether scan home page:

.Etherscan Home Page 
image::images\etherscan-1.png[]

Where:

. Is the Search Bar, you can search by Address, transacation hash, block number, token and apply some filters

. The latest blocks in the blockchain

. The latest transactions and the involved addresses

. Network selection, where the different networks of the Ethereum blockchain can be selected

If you search by Address you will be redirected to the Address page and you will see something like this:

.Address page
image::images\etherscan-2.png[]

Where:

. It's a summary of the wallet's balance

. It's a transaction list that includes the transaction method, the block that contains the transaction, the age of the transaction, the addresses involved, and so on.

If the address that you are searching is from a contract you will see something like this:


.Contract page
image::images\etherscan-3.png[]

. As you can see, the address type is now a Contract.

. You have now two new tabs:

.. The Contract tab that contains the contract bytecode

.. The Events tab that shows the internal events of the contract

=== OpenZeppelin

OpenZeppelin is a library with the most common smart contracts standards. For installing run the command:

[source, console]
----
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
----

For more information about this library, please visit the https://docs.openzeppelin.com/[official OpenZeppelin documentation]

== Frameworks

=== Wornking with Truffle suite

The truffle suite is a collection of tools for dealing with smart contracts and developing dApps.We have three key resources: 

* Truffle: A world-class development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), with the goal of making life simpler for developers.

* Ganache: A local Ethereum blockchain that you may use to deploy contracts, create applications, and perform tests.
It is accessible as both a desktop program and a command-line utility (formerly known as the TestRPC).

* Drizzle: A front-end libraries collection that make the dApp's development easier. The Drizzle's core is bases on a Redux store, therefore you can access to the development tools of Redux.

NOTE: For more information please refer to the https://trufflesuite.com/docs/[official truffle suite documentation]
