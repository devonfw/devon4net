== Debug

. Open for example Program.cs by clicking on it. The first time you open a C# file in Visual Studio Code, OmniSharp will load in the editor.

. To open the Debug view, click on the Debugging icon on the left side menu.

. Visual Studio Code will prompt you to add the missing assets to build and debug your app. Select Yes.

. Locate the green arrow at the top of the pane. Make sure the drop-down next to it has `.NET Core Launch (web)` selected.

. Add a breakpoint to your project by clicking on the **editor margin** (the space on the left of the line numbers in the editor).

. Select F5 or the green arrow to start debugging. The debugger stops execution of your program when it reaches the breakpoint you set in the previous step.

*   While debugging you can view your local variables in the top left pane or use the debug console.

. Select the green arrow at the top to continue debugging, or select the red square at the top to stop.

The following figure summarizes the most important points:
