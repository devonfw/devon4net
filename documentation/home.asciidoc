Integrating young and senior developers into .net core is the most difficult task we face in our projects.
There are several frameworks and architectures available on the market.

On the one hand, the goal is to develop an architecture that strikes a balance between best practices and current trends.
On the other hand, delivering a quick onboarding period while still using an architecture that allows us to expand while being productive.
In addition, the architecture must be market-compatible. This is what devon4net provides, which was built with a real clean layered architectural design.

"Make it work, make it right, make it fast."
