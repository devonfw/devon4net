= Introduction

The aim of this document is to show  how to get devon4net things done in a easy way.

= How to

== Start a new devonfw project

The _.Net Core 3.1_ template allows you to start developing an n-layer server application to provide the latest features. The template can be used in Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio 2019.

The application result can be deployed as a console application, microservice or web page.

To start developing with devon4Net template, please follow this instructions:

==== Using devon4Net template
==== Option 1

[listing]
....
Open your favourite terminal (Win/Linux/iOS)
Go to future project's path
Type dotnet new --install Devon4Net.WebAPI.Template
Type dotnet new Devon4NetAPI
Go to project's path
You are ready to start developing with devon4Net
....

==== Option 2
[listing]
....
Create a new dotnet` API` project from scratch
Add the NuGet package reference to your project:
Install-Package Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI.Configuration
....

Set up your project as follows in program.cs file:

[source, c#]
----

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Please use
            // Devonfw.Configure<Startup>(args);
            // Or : 

            WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .InitializeDevonFw()
                .Build()
                .Run();
        }
----

Set up your project as follows in startup.cs file:

```

    private IConfiguration Configuration { get; }


   public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }
    
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {

        services.ConfigureDevonFw(Configuration);
        SetupDatabase(services);
        
        ...
    }
    

    private void SetupDatabase(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Default is the database connection name in appsettings.json file
        services.SetupDatabase<TodoContext>(Configuration, "Default", DatabaseType.InMemory);
    }
    
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        app.ConfigureDevonFw();    
        ...
    }
    
```

Add the devonfw configuration options in your appsettings.json file


=== devon4net configuration files

To start using devon4net in your .net core application add this configuration in your appsettings.json file:

== devon4net Cobigen Guide

=== Overview

In this guide we will explain how to generate a new WebApi project from an OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification. This  means that we are going to use a “contract first” strategy. This is going to be possible due to these type of files that contain all the information about entities, operations, etc…

In order to make it work we are using https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen[CobiGen], a powerful tool for generating source code. CobiGen allows users to generate all the structure and code of the components, helping to save a lot of time otherwise wasted on repetitive tasks.

=== Getting things ready

==== devonfw Distribution

The devonfw distributions can be obtained from the https://coconet.capgemini.com/sf/frs/do/listReleases/projects.apps2_devon/frs.devon_distribution[TeamForge releases library] and are packaged in zips files that include all the needed tools, software and configurations.

It is not necessary to install nor configure anything. Just extracting the zip content is enough to have a fully functional devonfw. The only thing you have to do is run *create-or-update-workspace.bat* and then *update-all-workspaces.bat* to set up all the needed tools.

==== devon4net Templates

We are going to use the template of devon4net as a base to generate all the code, so what we have to do now is to download said template using the following steps.

First of all you have to set up all the environment for .NET, you can do this using https://devon4net.github.io/environment.html[the following tutorial]. Next we are going to create a new folder where we want to have the WebAPI project, lastly we are going to open the terminal there.

Type the following:

    dotnet new -i Devon4Net.WebAPI.Template
    
and then:

    dotnet new Devon4NetAPI
    
==== OpenAPI File

In order to let CobiGen generate all the files, we first have to make some modifications to our OpenAPI file. 

It is obligatory to put the _“x-rootpackage”_ tag to indicate where CobiGen will place the generated files as well as the _"x-component"_ tags for each component, keep in mind that due to CobiGen's limitations each component *_must_* have its own entity.

You can read more information about how to configure your OpenAPI file and a working example https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki/cobigen-openapipluginfull-example[here].

=== Generating files

Cobigen allow us to generate the files in two different ways. One of them is using Eclipse which it can be done by using the its graphical interface. The other way to generate the code is using the Cobigen` CLI` tool.

==== Generating files through Eclipse
In order to generate the files using Eclipse we need to follow some simple steps.

First we are going to import our basic devon4net WebAPI Project into Eclipse. to do so open Eclipse with the “eclipse-main.bat” file that can be found in the devon distribution root folder. Once we are inside of Eclipse we go to *File > Open projects from file system...* and, under "Directory", search for your project.

[[img-cobigen]]
image::images/Project_selection.png["cobigen", width=="600", link=="images/Project_selection.png"]

Next we copy our OpenAPI file into the root folder of the project.

[[img-cobigen]]
image::images/OpenAPI_file_root_folder.png["cobigen", width=="300", link=="images/OpenAPI_file_root_folder.png"]

And then we right click on OpenAPI file and then select *CobiGen > Generate...* It will display a window like this:

[[img-cobigen]]
image::images/cobigen_generate0.png["cobigen", width=="800", link=="images/cobigen_generate0.png"]

To select all .NET features choose *CRUD devon4net Server* otherwise you can select only those that interest you.

[[img-cobigen]]
image::images/cobigen_generate1.png["cobigen", width=="800", link=="images/cobigen_generate1.png]

Ones you select all the files that you want to generate, click on the _“Finish”_ button to generate all the source code.

==== Generating files through Cobigen` CLI`

In order to generate the files using the Cobigen` CLI` it is needed to do the following steps:

1. Go to devonfw distribution folder
2. Run *console.bat*, this will open a console.
3. Go to the folder you downloaded the *devon4net template* and your *yml* file.
4. Run the command:

    cobigen generate {yourOpenAPIFile}.yml

5. A list of increments will be printed so that you can start the generation. It has to be selected *CRUD devon4net Server* increment.

=== Configuration

==== Dependency Injection configuration

At this point it is needed to make some modifications in the code in order to configure correctly the server. To do so it is needed to locate the services and the repositories files that were created in *Devon4Net.WebAPI.Implementation*

Services location:
[[img-cobigen]]
image::images/Services.png["cobigen", width=="300", link=="images/Services.png]

Repositories location:
[[img-cobigen]]
image::images/Repositories.png["cobigen", width=="300", link=="images/Repositories.png]

Now, we are going to open the following file *Devon4Net.WebAPI.Implementation\Configure\DevonConfiguration.cs*.
In there we have to add the Dependency Injection for the services and the repositories that Cobigen has generated. The following image is an example of what is needed to add.

[[img-cobigen]]
image::images/BussinessConfiguration.png["cobigen", width=="800", link=="images/BussinessConfiguration.png]

Moreover it is needed to remove the last line in order to be able to run the application:

    `throw new NotImplementedException(...);`

==== Configure data base

Cobigen is generating an empty context that has to be filled with manually in order to be able to work with the database. The context can be found in *[Project_Name]/Devon4Net.WebAPI.Implementation/Domain/Database/CobigenContext.cs*.

[[img-cobigen]]
image::images/CobigenContextLocation.png["cobigen", width=="350", link=="images/CobigenContextLocation.png]

==== Configure services

In order to finish the configuration of the services it is needed to go to each service file of the managements generated. 

In there we will see some `"NotImplementedExceptions"`, so it is needed to read carefully each comment inside of each exception in order to be able to use the service. It can be shown an example of the service with its `NotImplementedExceptions` comments:

[[img-cobigen]]
image::images/ServiceExample.png["cobigen", width=="800", link=="images/ServiceExample.png]

==== Run the application

After doing all the steps defined above, open a terminal in path: *[Project_Name]/Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI* and then type:

    dotnet run
    
This will deploy our application in our localhost with the port 8081, so when you click https://localhost:8082/swagger/index.html[here] (https://localhost:8082/swagger) you can see, in swagger, all the services and the data model.


== Use HTTP2 protocol

You can specify the` HTTP` protocol to be used on your devon4net application modifying some node values at _devonfw_ node in your appsettings configuration file.

=== HttpProtocol
The supported protocols are:

[options="header"]
|=======================
|*Protocol*|*Description*
|Http1| Http1 protocol
|Http2| Http2 Protocol
|Http1AndHttp2| Both supported
|=======================

===` SSL`
To activate the HTTP2, the _SslProtocol_ node must be set to _Tls12_ value.

The` SSL` protocol supported version values are: 

- Tls
- Tls11
- Tls12
- Tls13
- Ssl2
- Ssl3


== Create a certificate for development purposes

In order to create a valid certificate for development purposes the Open` SSL` tools are needed. 



=== Certificate authority (CA)

Run the next commands in a shell:

[source, numbered]
----
1. openssl req -x509 -nodes -new -sha256 -days 1024 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout RootCA.key -out RootCA.pem -subj "/C=ES/ST=Valencia/L=Valencia/O=Certificates/CN=localhost.local"
 
2. openssl x509 -outform pem -in RootCA.pem -out RootCA.crt
----

If you want to convert your certificate run the command:


[source, numbered]
----
openssl pkcs12 -export -out localhost.pfx -inkey RootCA.key -in RootCA.crt
----



=== Domain name certificate

Run the next commands in a shell:

[source, numbered]
----
1. openssl req -new -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.csr -subj "/C=ES/ST=Valencia/L=Valencia/O=Certificates/CN=localhost.local"

2. openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 1024 -in localhost.csr -CA RootCA.pem -CAkey RootCA.key -CAcreateserial -extfile domains.ext -out localhost.crt
----


Where the _domains.ext_ file should contain:

[source, numbered]
----
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = localhost
DNS.2 = localhost.local
DNS.3 = 127.0.0.1
DNS.4 = fake1.local
DNS.5 = fake2.local
----

If you want to convert your certificate run the command:


[source, numbered]
----
openssl pkcs12 -export -out localhost.pfx -inkey localhost.key -in localhost.crt 
----

== Setup the database driver

Add the database connection on the `SetupDatabase` method at Startup.cs
    
```
       private void SetupDatabase(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.SetupDatabase<TodoContext>(Configuration, "Default", WebAPI.Configuration.Enums.DatabaseType.InMemory);
        }
```

Where: 

[options="header"]
|=======================
|*Param*|*Description*
|`TodoContext`| Is the database context definition
|Default| Is the connection string defined at `_ConnectionString_` node at the appsettings configuration file 
|`WebAPI.Configuration.Enums.DatabaseType.InMemory`| Is the database driver selection. In this case InMemory data base is chosen
|=======================

The supported databases are:

        - SqlServer
        - Sqlite
        - InMemory
        - Cosmos
        - PostgreSQL
        - MySql
        - MariaDb
        - FireBird
        - Oracle
        - MSAccess


== Change the JWT encryption algorithm

In the appsettings.json configuration file, you can use the next values on the _SecretKeyLengthAlgorithm_ and _SecretKeyEncryptionAlgorithm_ nodes at JWT configuration:
