= [navy]#devon4net Guide#

== [navy]#Introduction#

Welcome to devon4net framework user guide. In this document you will find the information regarding how to start and deploy your project using the guidelines proposed in our solution.

All the  guidelines shown and used in this document are a set of rules and conventions proposed and supported by Microsoft and the industry.

== [navy]#The package#

Devon4Net package solution contains:

[options="header"]
|=======================
|*File / Folder*|*Content*
|Documentation| User documentation in HTML format
|Modules| Contains the source code of the different devon4net modules
|Samples| Different samples implemented in .NET and .NET Core. Also includes My Thai Star Devon flagship restaurant application
|Templates| Main .net Core template to start developing from scratch
|License| License agreement
|README.md| Github main page
|TERMS_OF_USE.asciidoc| The devon4net terms of use
|LICENSE| The devon license
|Other files| Such the code of conduct and contributing guide
|=======================

=== [navy]#Application templates#

The application templates given in the bundle are ready to use. 

At the moment .net Core template is supported. The template is ready to be used as a simple console Kestrel application or being deployed in a web server like IIS.


=== [navy]#Samples#

==== [navy]#My Thai Star#

You can find My Thai Star .NET port application at https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star/tree/develop/net[Github].

NOTE: As devon4net has been migrated to the latest version of .net core, the template is not finished yet.

== [navy]#Cookbook#
=== [navy]#Data management#
To use EF Core, install the package for the database provider(s) you want to target. This walk-through uses SQL Server.

For a list of available providers see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/index[Database Providers]
    
* Go to *Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console*

* Run *Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer*

We will be using some Entity Framework Tools to create a model from the database. So we will install the tools package as well:

* Run *Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools*

We will be using some ASP.NET Core Scaffolding tools to create controllers and views later on. So we will install this design package as well:

* Run *Install-Package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design*



==== [navy]#EF Code first#

In order to design your database model from scratch, we encourage to follow the Microsoft guidelines described  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/complex-data-model[here].
 
 
 
==== [navy]#EF Database first#

* Go to *Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console*

* Run the following command to create a model from the existing database:

[Source,c#]
----
Scaffold-DbContext "Your connection string to existing database" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models
----

The command will create the database context and the mapped entities as well inside of Models folder.

==== [navy]#Register your context with dependency injection#

Services are registered with dependency injection during application startup.

In order to register your database context (or multiple database context as well) you can add the following line at ConfigureDbService method at startup.cs:


[source, C#]
----
       private void SetupDatabase(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.SetupDatabase<TodoContext>(Configuration, "Default", WebAPI.Configuration.Enums.DatabaseType.InMemory);
        }
----

Where: 

[options="header"]
|=======================
|*Param*|*Description*
|TodoContext| Is the database context definition
|Default| Is the connection string defined at _ConnectionString_ node at the appsettings configuration file 
|WebAPI.Configuration.Enums.DatabaseType.InMemory| Is the database driver selection. In this case InMemory data base is chosen
|=======================

The supported databases are:

        - SqlServer
        - Sqlite
        - InMemory
        - Cosmos
        - PostgreSQL
        - MySql
        - MariaDb
        - FireBird
        - Oracle
        - MSAccess

=== [navy]#Repositories and Services#

_Services_ and _Repositories_ are an important part of devon4net proposal. To make them work properly, first of all must be declared and injected at Startup.cs at _DI_ Region.


_Services_ are declared in devon4net.Business.Common and injected in Controller classes when needed. Use services to build your application logic.


[[img-t-architecture]]
.Screenshot of devon4net.Business.Common project in depth
image::images/business_ide_ext.png["technical architecture", width="450", link="images/business_ide_ext.png"]

For example, My Thai Star Booking controller constructor looks like this:

[Source,c#]
----
        public BookingController(IBookingService bookingService, IMapper mapper)
        {
            BookingService = bookingService;
            Mapper = mapper;

        }
----



Currently devon4net has a _Unit of Work_ class in order to perform CRUD operations to database making use of your designed model context.

_Repositories_ are declared at _devon4net.Domain.UnitOfWork_ project and make use of _Unit of Work_ class.


The common methods to perform CRUD operations (where <T> is an entity from your model) are:


* Sync methods:
[Source,c#]
----
IList<T> GetAll(Expression<Func<T, bool>> predicate = null);
T Get(Expression<Func<T, bool>> predicate = null);
IList<T> GetAllInclude(IList<string> include, Expression<Func<T, bool>> predicate = null);
T Create(T entity);
void Delete(T entity);
void DeleteById(object id);
void Delete(Expression<Func<T, bool>> where);
void Edit(T entity);
----


* Async methods:


[Source,c#]
----

Task<IList<T>> GetAllAsync(Expression<Func<T, bool>> predicate = null);
Task<T> GetAsync(Expression<Func<T, bool>> predicate = null);
Task<IList<T>> GetAllIncludeAsync(IList<string> include, Expression<Func<T, bool>> predicate = null);

----


If you perform a Commit operation and an error happens, changes will be rolled back.

=== [navy]#Swagger integration#

The given templates allow you to specify the API contract through Swagger integration and the controller classes are the responsible of exposing methods making use of comments in the source code.

The next example shows how to comment the method with summaries in order to define the contract. Add (Triple Slash) XML Documentation To Swagger:

[Source,c#]
----
/// <summary>
/// Method to get reservations
/// </summary>
/// <response code="201">Ok.</response>
/// <response code="400">Bad request. Parser data error.</response>
/// <response code="401">Unauthorized. Authentication fail.</response>
/// <response code="403">Forbidden. Authorization error.</response>
/// <response code="500">Internal Server Error. The search process ended with error.</response>
[HttpPost]
[Route("/mythaistar/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/booking/search")]
//[Authorize(Policy = "MTSWaiterPolicy")]
[AllowAnonymous]
[EnableCors("CorsPolicy")]
public async Task<IActionResult> BookingSearch([FromBody]BookingSearchDto bookingSearchDto)
{

----


In order to be effective and make use of the comments to build the API contract, the project which contains the controller classes must generate the XML document file. To achieve this, the XML documentation file must be checked in project settings tab:

[[img-t-architecture]]
.Project settings tab
image::images/project_doc.png["technical architecture", width="450", link="images/project_doc.png"]

We propose to generate the file under the XmlDocumentation folder. For example in devon4net.Domain.Entities project in My Thai Star .NET implementation the output folder is:

    XmlDocumentation\devon4net.Business.Common.xml


The file _devon4net.Business.Common.xml_ won't appear until you build the project. Once the file is generated, please modify its properties as a resource and set it to be _Copy always_ .

[[img-t-architecture]]
.Swagger XML document file properties
image::images/doc_copy_always.png["technical architecture", width="450", link="images/doc_copy_always.png"]

Once you have this, the swagger user interface will show the method properties defined in your controller comments. 

Making use of this technique controller are not encapsulated to the application project. Also, you can develop your controller classes in different projects obtain code reusability.

Swagger comment:

[options="header"]
|=======================
|*Comment*|*Functionality*
|<summary>| Will map to the operation's summary
|<remarks>| Will map to the operation's description (shown as "Implementation Notes" in the UI)
|<response code="\###">| Specifies the different response of the target method
|<param>| Will define the parameter(s) of the target method
|
|=======================

Please check https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments[Microsoft's site] regarding to summary notations.

=== [navy]#Logging module#

An important part of life software is the need of using log and traces. devon4net has a log module pre-configured to achieve this important point.

By default Microsoft provides a logging module on .NET Core applications. This module is open and can it can be extended. devon4net uses the https://serilog.net/[serilog] implementation. This implementation provides a huge quantity information about events and traces.

==== [navy]#Log file#
devon4net can write the log information to a simple text file. You can configure the file name and folder at appsettings.json file (LogFile attribute) at devon4net.Application.WebApi project.


==== [navy]#Database log#
devon4net can write the log information to a SQLite database. You can configure the file name and folder at appsettings.json file (LogDatabase attribute) at devon4net.Application.WebApi project.

With this method you can launch queries in order to search the information you are looking for.

==== [navy]#Seq log#
devon4net can write the log information to a serilog server. You can configure the serilog URL at appsettings.json file (SeqLogServerUrl attribute) at devon4net.Application.WebApi project.

With this method you can make queries via HTTP.

image::images/serilog_seq.png[, link="images/serilog_seq.png"]


By default you can find the log information at _Logs_ folder.

=== [navy]#JWT module#

JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties allowing you to decode, verify and generate JWT.

You should use JWT for:

- Authentication : allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.

- Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties.  Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content.

The JWT module is configured at Startup.cs inside devon4net.Application.WebApi project from .NET Core template. In this class you can configure the different authentication policy and JWT properties.

Once the user has been authenticated, the client perform the call to the backend with the attribute _Bearer_ plus the token generated at server side. 

image::images/jwt.png[, link="images/jwt.png"]

On My Thai Star sample there are two predefined users: user0 and Waiter. Once they log in the application, the client (Angular/Xamarin) will manage the server call with the json web token. With this method we can manage the server authentication and authorization.

You can find more information about JWT at  https://jwt.io[jwt.io]


=== [navy]#AOP module#

AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) tracks al information when a method is call. AOP also tracks the input and output data when a method is call.

By default devon4net has AOP module pre-configured and activated for controllers at Startup.cs file at devon4net.Application.WebApi:


[Source,c#]
----
options.Filters.Add(new Infrastructure.AOP.AopControllerAttribute(Log.Logger));

options.Filters.Add(new Infrastructure.AOP.AopExceptionFilter(Log.Logger));
----

This configuration allows all Controller classes to be tracked. If you don't need to track the info comment the lines written before.


=== [navy]#Docker support#

devon4net Core projects are ready to be integrated with docker. 

https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star/tree/develop/net[My Thai Star application] sample is ready to be use with linux docker containers. The Readme file explains how to launch and setup the sample application.

* *angular* : Angular client to support backend. Just binaries.

* *database* : Database scripts and .bak file 

* *mailservice*: Microservice implementation to send notifications.

* *netcore*: Server side using .net core 2.0.x.
    
* *xamarin*: Xamarin client based on Excalibur framework from The Netherlands using XForms.


Docker configuration and docker-compose files are provided.


== [navy]#Testing with XUnit#
[quote, About xUnit.net, https://xunit.github.io/#documentation]
____
xUnit.net is a free, open source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework. Written by the original inventor of NUnit v2, xUnit.net is the latest technology for unit testing C#, F#, VB.NET and other .NET languages. xUnit.net works with ReSharper, CodeRush, TestDriven.NET and Xamarin. It is part of the .NET Foundation, and operates under their code of conduct. It is licensed under Apache 2 (an OSI approved license).
____

_Facts_ are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.

_Theories_ are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.

=== [navy]#The first test#

[Source,c#]
----
using Xunit;

namespace MyFirstUnitTests
{
    public class Class1
    {
        [Fact]
        public void PassingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(4, Add(2, 2));
        }

        [Fact]
        public void FailingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(5, Add(2, 2));
        }

        int Add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    }

|=======================


== [navy]#Publishing#
==== [navy]#Nginx#
In order to deploy your application to a Nginx server on Linux platform you can follow the instructions from _Microsoft_ link:./offline/nginx.html[here].

==== [navy]#IIS#

In this point is shown the configuration options that must implement the .Net Core application.

Supported operating systems:

* Windows 7 and newer
* Windows Server 2008 R2 and newer*

WebListener server will not work in a reverse-proxy configuration with IIS. You must use the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?tabs=aspnetcore2x[Kestrel server].

[underline]#IIS configuration#

Enable the Web Server (IIS) role and establish role services.

*Windows desktop operating systems*

Navigate to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features > Turn Windows features on or off (left side of the screen). Open the group for Internet Information Services and Web Management Tools. Check the box for IIS Management Console. Check the box for World Wide Web Services. Accept the default features for World Wide Web Services or customize the IIS features to suit your needs.

image::images/iis_1.png[, link="images/iis_1.png"]

*Conceptually, the IIS configuration described in this document also applies to hosting ASP.NET Core applications on Nano Server IIS, but refer to ASP.NET Core with IIS on Nano Server for specific instructions.

*Windows Server operating systems*
For server operating systems, use the Add Roles and Features wizard via the Manage menu or the link in Server Manager. On the Server Roles step, check the box for Web Server (IIS).

image::images/iis_2.png[, link="images/iis_2.png"]

On the Role services step, select the IIS role services you desire or accept the default role services provided.

image::images/iis_3.png[, link="images/iis_3.png"]
Proceed through the Confirmation step to install the web server role and services. A server/IIS restart is not required after installing the Web Server (IIS) role.


[underline]#Install the .NET Core Windows Server Hosting bundle#

. Install the .NET Core Windows Server Hosting bundle on the hosting system. The bundle will install the .NET Core Runtime, .NET Core Library, and the ASP.NET Core Module. The module creates the reverse-proxy between IIS and the Kestrel server. Note: If the system doesn't have an Internet connection, obtain and install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable before installing the .NET Core Windows Server Hosting bundle.

. Restart the system or execute net stop was /y followed by net start w3svc from a command prompt to pick up a change to the system PATH.


NOTE: If you use an IIS Shared Configuration, see ASP.NET Core Module with IIS Shared Configuration.

To configure IISIntegration service options, include a service configuration for IISOptions in ConfigureServices:

[source, c#]
----
services.Configure<IISOptions>(options => 
{
    ...
});
----


[options="header"]
|=======================
|Option|Default|Setting
|AutomaticAuthentication| true |If true, the authentication middleware sets the HttpContext.User and responds to generic challenges. If false, the authentication middleware only provides an identity (HttpContext.User) and responds to challenges when explicitly requested by the AuthenticationScheme. Windows Authentication must be enabled in IIS for AutomaticAuthentication to function.
|AuthenticationDisplayName | null| 	Sets the display name shown to users on login pages.
|ForwardClientCertificate |true|If true and the  MS-ASPNETCORE-CLIENTCERT request header is present, the HttpContext.Connection.ClientCertificate is populated.
|=======================


[underline]#web.config#

The web.config file configures the ASP.NET Core Module and provides other IIS configuration. Creating, transforming, and publishing web.config is handled by Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web, which is included when you set your project's SDK at the top of your .csproj file, <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">. To prevent the MSBuild target from transforming your web.config file, add the <IsTransformWebConfigDisabled> property to your project file with a setting of true:

[source, xml]
----
<PropertyGroup>
  <IsTransformWebConfigDisabled>true</IsTransformWebConfigDisabled>
</PropertyGroup>
----

==== [navy]#Azure#
